    /*
     * The Proxy Pattern allows one object (the proxy) to control access to another object (the real subject).
     * It acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object, providing additional functionality
     * without changing the core object.
     *
     * Key Points:
     * 1. **Access Control**: Proxies control access to the real object. This is useful for permissions or
     *    managing resource-heavy objects that should only be instantiated when needed.
     *
     * 2. **Lazy Initialization**: The proxy can instantiate the real object only when necessary. This can improve
     *    performance by delaying the creation of expensive objects until they are required.
     *
     * 3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Proxies can be used to add extra functionalities such as logging requests,
     *    caching responses, or keeping track of stats without modifying the real objectâ€™s code.
     *
     * 4. **Remote Object Representation**: The proxy can represent an object located remotely (e.g., on a different
     *    server). This allows for communication with the remote object as if it were local.
     *
     * 5. **Usage in Java and IntelliJ IDEA**: This pattern is commonly used when working with large-scale
     *    applications. In IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the "Navigate > Type Hierarchy" to see how proxies
     *    interact with real subjects by tracing class hierarchies. Use the "Call Hierarchy" to check
     *    client interactions with proxies.
     *
     * Example Scenarios:
     * - Security Proxies: Control access to an object (e.g., authentication).
     * - Virtual Proxies: Delay object creation until it's needed (e.g., expensive database connections).
     * - Remote Proxies: Represent objects located in different environments (e.g., RMI).
     *
     * This Proxy Pattern implementation can be useful for GitHub documentation to remind you that the proxy
     * manages access to other objects, providing control over instantiation, access, and adding auxiliary
     * functionalities.
